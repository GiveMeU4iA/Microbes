      Antibiotic resistance is not your body resisting antibiotics due to a
      "tolerance".
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      Antibiotic resistance refers to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics
      through evolution, mutation, and horizonatl gene transfer.

      In 2019, 4.95 million deaths were associated with antibiotic resistance,
      1.27m were a direct result of it.

    <div class="line">
      Overprescription of antibiotics has resulting in bacteria developing
      antibiotic resistance more rapidly over time.
    </div>
    <div class="line">
      Antibiotic pollution has contributed to the problem by allowing bacteria
      to mutate and share genes (HGT) outside of a human host.
